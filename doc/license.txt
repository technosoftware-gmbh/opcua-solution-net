    documentation.</li>

    <li><strong>You are not allowed to resell, rent, lease or sublicense an unmodified or modified version of this Software as standalone product, nor to build

    <li>Licensee's applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the licensed Software; applications may not pass on functionality which in a

    of the Software together with your application)</li>

terminate this agreement if Licensee fails to pay any required license fee(s) or otherwise fails to comply with the license terms and conditions set forth herein. Technosoftware shall 
give written notice to Licensee of such fault, and if such fault has not been remedied within thirty (30) days after, the license granted hereunder shall

company location in Rüfenach, Switzerland.</p>

<p>This Agreement is the parties' entire agreement relating to the Software. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, 
warranties, and representations with respect to its subject matter, and following Licensee's acceptance of this license by clicking on the "Accept" Button or by installing 
and using the Software, will prevail over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or any other communications by or between the parties. 
No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party</p>

<h3>Export Control</h3>

<p>Licensee acknowledges that the licensed Software may be subject to export control restrictions of various countries. Licensee shall fully comply with all
applicable export license restrictions and requirements as well as with all laws and regulations relating to the importation of the licensed Software and/or
modified Software and/or applications and shall procure all necessary governmental authorizations, including without limitation, all necessary licenses,
approvals, permissions or consents, where necessary for the reexportation of the licensed Software, modified Software or applications.</p>

<h3>No Implied License</h3>
<p>There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with 
Technosoftware and its licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the licensed Software and/or modified Software, as applicable, 
with any other software or hardware not delivered by Technosoftware under this Agreement.</p>

<h3>Surviving Sections</h3>
<p>Any terms and conditions that by their nature or otherwise reasonably should survive a cancellation or termination of this Agreement shall also be deemed to survive. 
Such terms and conditions include, but are not limited to the following Sections: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Section 3 shall not survive if the Agreement is terminated for material breach.</p>

<h3>Severability</h3>
<p>If any of the above provisions are held to be in violation of applicable law, void, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then such provisions are herewith waived or 
amended to the extent necessary for the Agreement to be otherwise enforceable in such jurisdiction. However, if in Technosoftware’s opinion deletion or amendment of 
any provisions of the Agreement by operation of this paragraph unreasonably compromises the rights or increase the liabilities of Technosoftware or its licensors, 
Technosoftware reserves the right to terminate the Agreement</p>
