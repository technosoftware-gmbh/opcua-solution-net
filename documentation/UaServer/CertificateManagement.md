# Certificate Management and Validation

The stack provides several certificate management functions including a custom CertificateValidator that implements the validation rules required by the specification. The CertificateValidator is created automatically when the ApplicationConfiguration is loaded. Any WCF channels or endpoints that are created with that ApplicationConfiguration will use it.

The CertificateValidator uses the trust lists in the ApplicationConfiguration to determine whether a certificate is trusted. A certificate that fails validation is always placed in the Rejected Certificates store. Applications can receive notifications when an invalid certificate is encountered by using the event defined on the CertificateValidator class.

The Stack also provides the CertificateIdentifier class which can be used to specify the location of a certificate. The Find() method will look up the certificate based on the criteria specified (SubjectName, Thumbprint or DER Encoded Blob).

Each application has a SecurityConfiguration which must be managed carefully by the Administrator since making a mistake could prevent applications from communicating or create security risks. The elements of the SecurityConfiguration are described in the table below:

| **Name**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ApplicationCertificate      | Specifies where the private key for the Application Instance Certificate is located. Private keys should be in the Personal (My) store for the LocalMachine or the CurrentUser. Private keys installed in the LocalMachine store are only accessible to users that have been explicitly granted permissions. |
| TrustedIssuerCertificates   | Specifies the Certificate Authorities that issue certificates which the application can trust. The structure includes the location of a Certificate Store and a list of individual Certificates.                                                                                                             |
| TrustedPeerCertificates     | Specifies the certificates for other applications which the application can trust. The structure includes the location of a Certificate Store and a list of individual Certificates.                                                                                                                         |
| InvalidCertificateDirectory | Specifies where rejected Certificates can be placed for later review by the Admistrator (a.k.a. Rejected Certificates Store)                                                                                                                                                                                 |

The Administrator needs to create an application instance certificate when applications are installed, when the ApplicationUri or when the hostname changes. The Administrator can use the OPC UA Configuration Tool included in the solution or use the tools provided by their Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). If the certificate is changed the Application Configuration needs to be updated.

Once the certificate is installed the Administrator needs to ensure that all users who can access the application have permission to access the Certificateâ€™s private key.
