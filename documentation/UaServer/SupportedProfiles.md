| Core 2017 Server Facet                     | This Facet defines the core functionality required for any UA Server implementation. The core functionality includes the ability to discover endpoints, establish secure communication channels, create Sessions, browse the AddressSpace and read and/or write to Attributes of Nodes. The key requirements are support for a single Session, support for the Server and Server Capabilities Object, all mandatory Attributes for Nodes in the AddressSpace, and authentication with UserName and Password. For broad applicability, it is recommended that Servers support multiple transport and security Profiles. This Facet supersedes the "Core Server Facet". Also supported are: **User Token – User Name Password Server Facet **This Facet indicates that a user token that is comprised of a username and password is supported. This user token can affect the behaviour of the ActivateSession Service. **SecurityPolicy – None** This security Facet defines a security policy used for configurations with the lowest security needs. This security policy can affect the behaviour of the CreateSession and ActivateSession Services. It also results in a SecureChannel which has no channel security. By default, this security policy shall be disabled if any other security policy is available. | Yes           |
| Sessionless Server Facet                   | Defines the use of Sessionless Service invocation in a Server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | No            |
| Reverse Connect Server Facet               | This Facet defines support of reverse connectivity in a Server. Usually, a connection is opened by the Client before starting the UA-specific handshake. This will fail, however, when Servers are behind firewalls with no open ports to connect to. In the reverse connectivity scenario, the Server opens the connection and starts with a ReverseHello message requesting that the Client establish a Secure Channel using this connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No            |

| Standard Event Subscription Server Facet | This Facet specifies the standard support for subscribing to events and is intended to supplement any of the FullFeatured Profiles. Support of this Facet requires the implementation of Event Types representing the Events that the Server can report and their specific fields. It also requires at least the Server Object to have the EventNotifier Attribute set. It includes the Services to Create, Modify and Delete Subscriptions and to Add, Modify and Remove Monitored Items for Object Nodes with an “EventNotifier Attribute”. Creating a monitoring item may include a filter that includes SimpleAttribute FilterOperands and a select list of Operators. The operators include: Equals, IsNull, GreaterThan, LessThan, GreaterThanOrEqual, LessThanOrEqual, Like, Not, Between, InList, And, Or, Cast, BitwiseAnd, BitwiseOr and TypeOf. Support of more complex filters is optional. This Facet has been updated to include several optional Base Information ConformanceUnits. These ConformanceUnits are optional to allow for backward compatibility, in the future these optional ConformanceUnits will become required, and so it is highly recommended that all servers support them. | Yes           |
| Address Space Notifier Server Facet      | This Facet requires the support of a hierarchy of Object Nodes that are notifiers and Nodes that are event sources. The hierarchy is commonly used to organize a plant into areas that can be managed by different operators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Yes           |

This Facet builds upon the A&C Alarm Server Facet. The term non-exclusive means more than one sub-state can be active at a time. For example, if a temperature exceeds the HighHigh limit the associated non-exclusive LevelAlarm will be in both the High and the HighHigh sub-state. This Facet requires that a server support at least one of the optional alarm models: Limit, RateOfChange or Deviation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | No            |
| A & C Previous Instances Server Facet     | This Facet requires support for Conditions with previous states that still require action on the part of the operator. This Facet builds upon the A&C Base Condition Server Facet. A common use case for this Facet is a safety critical system that requires that all Alarms be acknowledged even if it the original problem goes away and the Alarm returns to the inactive state. In these cases, the previous state with active Alarm is still reported by the Server until the Operator acknowledges it. When a Condition has previous states, it will produce events with different Branch identifiers. When previous state no longer needs attention, the branch will disappear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | No            |
| A & C Dialog Server Facet                 | This Facet requires support of Dialog Conditions. This Facet builds upon the A & C BaseCondition Server Facet Dialogs are ConditionTypes used to request user input. They are typically used when a Server has entered some state that requires intervention by a Client. For example, a Server monitoring a paper machine indicates that a roll of paper has been wound and is ready for inspection. The Server would activate a Dialog Condition indicating to the user that an inspection is required. Once the inspection has taken place the user responds by informing the Server of an accepted or unaccepted inspection allowing the process to continue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No            |
| A & C CertificateExpiration Server Facet  | This Facet requires support of the CertificateExpirationAlarmType. It is used to inform Clients when the Server’s Certificate is within the defined expiration period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No            |
| A & E Wrapper Facet                       | This Facet specifies the requirements for a UA Server that wraps an OPC Alarm & Event (AE) Server (COM). This Profile identifies the sub-set of the UA Alarm & Condition model which is provided by the COM OPC AE specification. It is intended to provide guidance to developers who are creating servers that front-end existing applications. It is important to note that some OPC A&E COM Servers may not support all of the functionality provided by an OPC UA A&C server, in these cases similar functionality maybe available via some non-OPC interface. For example, if an A&E COM server does not support sending Alarm Acknowledgement messages to the system that it is obtaining alarm information from, this functionality may be available via some out of scope features in the underlying Alarm system. Another possibility is that the underlying system does not require acknowledgements or automatically acknowledges the alarm. | No            |

| Method Server Facet               | This Facet specifies the support of Method invocation via the Call service. Methods are “lightweight” functions which are like the methods of a class found in any object-oriented programming language. A Method can have its scope bounded by an owning Object or an owning ObjectType. Methods with an ObjectType as their scope are like static methods in a class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes           |
| Auditing Server Facet             | This Facet requires the support of Auditing which includes the Standard Event Subscription Server Facet. Support of this Facet requires that Audit Events be produced when a client performs some action to change the state of the server, such as changing the AddressSpace, inserting or updating a value etc. The auditEntryId passed by the Client is a field contained in every Audit Event and allows actions to be traced across multiple systems. The Audit Event Types and their fields must be exposed in the Server’s AddressSpace **Note:** Auditing Server Facet is supported but Compliance Test Tool doesn’t support any test cases for this. | Yes           |
| Node Management Server Facet      | This Facet requires the support of the Services that allow the Client to add, modify and delete Nodes in the AddressSpace. These Services provide an interface which can be used to configure Servers. This means all changes to the AddressSpace are expected to persist even after the Client has disconnected from the Server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | No            |
| User Role Base Server Facet       | This Facet defines support of the OPC UA Information Model to expose configured user roles and permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No            |
| User Role Management Server Facet | This Facet defines support of the OPC UA approach to manage user roles and permissions and to grant access to Nodes and Services based on the assigned roles and permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | No            |

| Client Redundancy Server Facet      | This Facet defines the Server actions that are required for support of redundant Clients. Support of this Facet requires the implementation of the TransferSubscriptions Service which allows the transfer of Subscriptions from one Client’s Session to another Client’s Session.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No            |
| Redundancy Transparent Server Facet | This Facet requires support for transparent redundancy. If Servers implement transparent redundancy, then the failover from one Server to another is transparent to the Client such that the Client is unaware that a failover has occurred; the Client does not need to do anything at all to keep data flowing. This type of redundancy is usually a hardware solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | No            |
| Redundancy Visible Server Facet     | This Facet specifies the support for non-transparent redundancy. Failover for this type of redundancy requires the Client to monitor Server status and to switch to a backup Server if it detects a failure. The Server shall expose the methods of failover it supports (cold, warm or hot). The failover method tells the Client what it must do when connecting to a Server and when a failure occurs. Cold redundancy requires a Client to reconnect to a backup Server after the initial Server has failed. Warm redundancy allows a Client to connect to multiple Servers, but only one Server will be providing values. In hot redundancy multiple Servers are able to provide data and a Client can connect to multiple Servers for the data. | No            |
