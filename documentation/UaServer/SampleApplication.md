## Directory Structure

We provide an online help for the current version: [OPC UA Solution NET Online Help](https://technosoftware.com/help/OPCUaSolutionNet/33/) which also contains updated information about the directory structure.

## Solution

The main OPC UA Solution can be found in the root of the repository and is named.

- Tutorials.sln

The solution contains two sample Servers, as well as two sample servers used by these Servers.

## Prerequisites

Once the dotnet command is available, navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the repository / and execute the following command:

dotnet restore /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform="Any CPU" Tutorials.sln

This command restores the tree of dependencies.

## Start the server

1.  Open a command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the folder tutorials/SampleCompany/Simple/SampleServer.
3.  To run the server sample type  
       
    dotnet run --no-restore --framework net8.0 --project SampleCompany.SampleServer.csproj --autoaccept
    -   The server is now running and waiting for connections.
    -   The --autoaccept flag allows to auto accept unknown certificates and should only be used to simplify testing.

## Start the client

1.  Open a command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the folder tutorials/SampleCompany/Simple/SampleClient.
3.  To run the client sample type   
      
    dotnet run --no-restore --framework net8.0 --project SampleCompany.SampleClient.csproj --autoaccept
    -   The client connects to the OPC UA console sample server running on the same host.
    -   The --autoaccept flag allows to auto accept unknown certificates and should only be used to simplify testing.
4.  If not using the --autoaccept auto accept option, on first connection, or after certificates were renewed, the server may have refused the client certificate. Check the server and client folder %LocalApplicationData%/OPC Foundation/pki/rejected for rejected certificates. To approve a certificate copy it to the %LocalApplicationData%/OPC Foundation/pki/trusted.

## Check the output

If everything was done correctly the client should show the following lines:

```
