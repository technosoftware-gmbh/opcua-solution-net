# Develop OPC UA Clients with C\# for of .NET

The OPC UA Client .NET offers a fast and easy access to the OPC Unified Architecture (UA) technology. Develop OPC UA compliant Clients with C# targeting .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. For backward compatibility we also provide .NET 4.8 support.

.NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0 allows you develop applications that run on all common platforms available today, including Linux, macOS and Windows 8.1/10/11 (including embedded/IoT editions) without requiring platform-specific modifications.

The **OPC UA Client .NET API** defines classes which can be used to implement an OPC client capable to access OPC servers supporting different profiles with the same API. These classes manage client side state information; provide higher level abstractions for OPC tasks such as managing sessions and subscriptions or saving and restoring connection information for later use.

**Purpose and audience of document**

Microsoftâ€™s .NET is an application development environment that supports multiple languages and provides a large set of standard programming APIs. This document defines an Application Programming Interface (API) for OPC UA Client development based on the .NET programming model.

This document gives a short overview of the functionality of the OPC UA .NET solutions family. The goal of this document is to give an introduction and can be used as base for your own implementations.
